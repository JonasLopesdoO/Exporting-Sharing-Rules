# Package.xml builder reference
This is a file reference to be consulted when working on sfdx projects. Sometimes we forgot how to declare some components on the package.xml since there are a lot of metadata types and some rules, to be used on Salesforce. This reference could be a safe and trustable place to consult without going to blogs or non-related documentation or even testing by brute force by yourself.
